        <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Throne-Glass-Sarah-J-Maas-ebook/dp/B007N6JEII/ref=sr_1_1?tag=filbat-20">Throne of Glass</a>: Sarah J. Maas; Fantasy</dt>
        <dd>Terribly written first half and characters become better by the end, but I was told to get through this one so that I could move to the books afterwards which were apparently much improved. Overall a series of books about the chosen one and a lot of interesting world-building to demonstrate how interconnected everything is.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Crown-Midnight-Sarah-J-Maas/dp/1619630621/ref=sr_1_3?tag=filbat-20">Crown of Midnight</a>: Sarah J. Maas; Fantasy</dt>
        <dd>The writing did improve. Lots of fleshing out of all the characters.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Heir-Fire-Sarah-J-Maas/dp/1619630656/ref=sr_1_5?tag=filbat-20">Heir of Fire</a>: Sarah J. Maas; Fantasy</dt>

        <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Queen-Shadows-Throne-Glass-Book-ebook/dp/B00TU3BTUI/ref=sr_1_4?tag=filbat-20">Queen of Shadows</a>: Sarah J. Maas; Fantasy</dt>

        <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Morning-Star-Book-Rising-Trilogy-ebook/dp/B00SPVPX2G?tag=filbat-20">Morning Star</a>: Pierce Brown; SF</dt>
        <dd>The conclusion to the Red Rising trilogy - I pre-ordered this immediately after finishing Golden Son and I don't have any regrets. Plenty of gut-wrenching twists.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/The-Effective-Executive-Definitive-Getting/dp/0060833459?tag=filbat-20">The Effective Executive: The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done</a>: Peter F. Drucker; Business</dt>
        <dd>Full of a lot of decent advice about making sure that you are effective, and aimed towards the knowledge worker who is an executive whether they're the CEO or at the very bottom of the totem pole. Lots of good insights but a pretty dated writing style (possibly to do with the first publishing being in 1967), which made some points hit home a little less than they could have.</dd>

        <dt class="recommended"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00PI184XG/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o08_?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=filbat-20">The Forever War</a>: Joe Haldeman; SF</dt>
        <dd>The first time I read this book it was immediately after reading Starship Troopers, and I missed the allegory entirely. This reading was much better; still a fantastic SF book.</dd>

        <dt class="recommended"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B01CYVHYSS/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o03_?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=filbat-20">Spelunky</a>: Derek Yu; Games</dt>
        <dd>Derek Yu tells the story of Spelunky, as well as reflecting a little bit on what brought him there. A really inspiring read.</dd>

        <dt class="recommended"><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B002YJK5L4/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o09_?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=filbat-20">Food Rules: An Eater's Manual</a>: Michael Pollan</dt>
        <dd>Michael Pollan distills all of the food and nutrition research he's read into simple, easy-to-follow rules about what you should eat. Takes about a half hour to read and you're guaranteed to come out with some simple heuristics that get you eating more of what you should.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000SEOWBG/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o06_?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=filbat-20">The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life</a>: Twyla Tharp</dt>
        <dd>Twyla Tharp (a prolific choreographer) talks a bit about the preparation and effort that goes into her being as creative as possible at all times. A little weird at times, but a pretty good read.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B0046LU7H0/ref=oh_aui_d_detailpage_o03_?ie=UTF8&psc=1&tag=filbat-20">Early Retirement Extreme: A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence</a>: Jacob Lund Fisker; Personal Finance</dt>
        <dd>I try to read one or two personal finance books a year; after seeing this one on <a href="https://push.cx/2015/media-reviews">Peter's list</a> I figured I should check it out. It didn't grab me as much as I expected it to.</dd>

        <h2>Games Played</h2>
        <dt class="recommended"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143884/machi-koro">Machi Koro</a></dt>
        <dd>A really neat city building game, where you need to carefully manage your economy in order to build your city faster than anyone else. I enjoyed this a lot.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65334/flash-duel">Flash Duel</a></dt>
        <dd>Bought on <a href="https://push.cx/2015/media-reviews">Peter's recommendation</a>; basically Street Fighter as Board Game. I'm impressed by the depth and really liked it, although I haven't had a chance to try the 2v1 mode yet.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://store.na.square-enix.com/product/286954/final-fantasy-explorers-3ds">Final Fantasy Explorers</a></dt>
        <dd>A more-accessible Monster Hunter, geared towards Final Fantasy fans. I liked that combat moved a lot faster and the way that you level up your skills has a ton of potential, but the rest of the game is a watered-down Monster Hunter.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://www.zelda.com/hyrule-warriors/">Hyrule Warriors</a></dt>
        <dd>Dynasty Warriors, re-skinned with Legend of Zelda characters. Super heavy on the fan service, but ok if you'd like to play a game where you kill thousands of enemies in a match. Has two-player co-op that makes things a little easier, although I didn't struggle much in normal mode singleplayer.</dd>

        <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://splatoon.nintendo.com/">Splatoon</a></dt>
        <dd>I was really impressed by this one. Nintendo took the things that make shooters fun and then stripped away all of the parts that made them too adult or less fun, leaving behind a solid core with an interesting movement mechanic. Matches are super fast, which makes it great to drop in and play a few rounds of anytime.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/VjRAs6CTHXz3CUkD9wWULz8tl0kInJXx">Story of Seasons</a></dt>
        <dd>This is the latest Harvest Moon game (the trademark is apparently still owned by Natsume). They've streamlined the farming/crop growing, but there's a really punishing stamina system that ended up pushing me towards just min-maxing my daily routine in a way I'm not sure I liked.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://www.atlus.com/etrianmd/">Etrian Mystery Dungeon</a></dt>
        <dd>A party-based roguelike; I really wanted to like this, but I'm not super into roguelikes. When your party dies, it's a significant setback.</dd>

        <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://www.starrealms.com/">Star Realms</a></dt>
        <dd>A nice and simple deck-building game that's quick to pick up and play but still has room for good strategizing. Has expansions but they're all set additions of ~15 cards vs. a TCG's booster pack style.</dd>

        <dt><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/173346/7-wonders-duel">7 Wonders: Duel</a></dt>
        <dd>Kind of really complicated. Has a neat drafting mechanic for you to build your civilization from though.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://starfoxzero.nintendo.com/?pid=SFZ_CA_EN">Star Fox Zero</a></dt>
        <dd>When I learned this was coming I got really excited; I remember playing a ton of Star Fox 64. But they went full Wii U, and the game feels more like a tech demo - the controls made it too hard for me to actually get past the third level, and I dropped it. <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/20/11466308/not-a-review-star-fox-zero">Someone from Polygon couldn't make it through either and sums up my thoughts better</a>.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://www.pokkentournament.com/">Pokken Tournament</a></dt>
        <dd>I guess this is Tekken? But with Pokemon? I haven't played Tekken in a very long time. It's a decent enough fighting game, as someone who doesn't really play fighting games. No complaints (although everyone wiped the floor with me in online mode).</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/252410/">Steamworld Dig</a></dt>
        <dd>I first played this on the PC a few years back, but got a chance to come back to it for 3DS this year. It's still just as good; super satisfying core game loop (dig for money, use money for upgrades so you can dig deeper for more money for more upgrades).</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://galaxytrail.com/freedomplanetsite/">Freedom Planet</a></dt>
        <dd>Kind of a cluttered, harder to understand Sonic the Hedgehog.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/345820/">Shantae and the Pirate's Curse</a></dt>
        <dd>This reminds me a lot of the games that I used to play on the Sega Genesis for some reason. I wasn't really able to get into it.</dd>

        <dt><a href="http://affordablespaceadventures.com/">Affordable Space Adventures</a></dt>
        <dd>A cute little side scroller puzzler game. Really interesting control scheme where your Wii U gamepad controls the different ship systems.</dd>

        <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/pocket-card-jockey-3ds">Pocket Card Jockey</a></dt>
        <dd>Adorably horse racing solitaire that doesn't make any sense but is oddly super compelling. <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/5/4/11591708/pocket-card-jockey-game-freak-gameplay-video-overview-nintendo-3ds">I can't stop playing either.</a></dd>

        <dd>I found a space icon set that I really liked, so I spent some time fiddling and made a really simple infinite runner.</dd>

          <dd>The first Walt Longmire book; also recommended by <a href="http://ki.tt">Kitt</a>. Some parts were hard to follow because I don't know American native history, but fun to read. Very twisty.</dd>

          <dd>The published results of a study on how companies go from being good, bad, or mediocre to great - lots of fascinating stories about each of the companies studied (and the ones they were compared to that didn't do as well).</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00IIUU0HC?tag=filbat-20">Payments Systems in the U.S.</a></dt>

          <dd>A short novella that's told almost entirely from the perspective of a newscaster covering the end of the world. Not as good as I was hoping.</dd>

          <dd>This is set in Neal Asher's Polity universe, but a lot more focused on the AIs than previous novels have been (or at least, that I've read). Moves pretty fast, I really enjoyed it.</dd>

          <dd>This game is a mashup of a lot of different concepts - roguelike procedural exploration, squad tactics, and tower defense. It's also turned based, which was a surprise. Pretty good; I found singleplayer to be crushingly difficult, but hear multiplayer is better.</dd>

          <dd>I read a review of this game that called it "platforming perfection"; I'm inclined to agree. Super well done and the co-op is fantastic as well (and fully co-operative; nothing you do detracts from the other player in any way, and you can't steal their resources).</dd>

          <dd>Another lying game like Battlestar Galactica, but heavier on the lying and much less complex. Good, although hard for the good guys to win (which makes those ones feel even more rewarding).</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue">Flash Point: Fire Rescue</a></dt>
          <dd>You and friends play firefighters trying to get people out of a burning building. This game had a lot of complexity to it that none of us were expecting; we lost because I don't think we understood what to do for the first half of the game.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://www.explodingkittens.com/">Exploding Kittens</a></dt>
          <dd>Reminds me of UNO a little bit - the start of the game is kind of slow, but the intensity continually escalates. The end of the game becomes very high intensity as everyone tries to take each other out.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/681/quarto">Quarto!</a></dt>
          <dd>A connect four game that's based on recognizing the similarities between the pieces you're connecting, with an interesting mechanic: the other player chooses what piece you place next.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21763/mr-jack">Mr. Jack</a></dt>
          <dd>A stealth game where one player plays Jack the ripper and the other plays a detective trying to catch him. Interesting mechanics, although a bit slow to get started.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/138161/firefly-game">Firefly: The Game</a></dt>
          <dd>Very cool movement mechanic where you can mosey along or go for full engine burns, but on our first playthrough we struggled with figuring out whether we wanted to play the game for a while and experience it all or just race to the goal. Comes with multiple scenarios so that the victory condition is different each time you play, which opens up a lot of options for playing it again but being forced into different strategies. A little complex at first.</dd>

          <dd>If you ever wanted to create your own Mario levels, this is the game for you. Lots of interesting interactions between game pieces, a solid level editor, and more levels and creativity on display than you can shake a stick at.</dd>

          <dd>Philipp Stollenmayer improves on Pancake and makes a game that's a little less punishing, while still being a decent challenge. Good one-button game.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://www.zelda.com/windwaker/">The Legend of Zelda: the windwaker (HD)</a></dt>
          <dd>This is my favorite Zelda game, and the HD version mostly improves on it. Did you know the long sailing segments were added because the gamecube couldn't handle loading the world map? They mask loading screens. In the new version that restriction doesn't apply, so you can actually get a sail that helps you go faster.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/dash-quest/id973161926?mt=8&at=11l5NI">Dash Quest</a></dt>
          <dd>An OK infinite runner with kinda-interesting RPG mechanics tacked on. The in-game economy is pretty broken to influence you towards of in-app purchases.</dd>

          <dd>I downloaded a demo for this on a whim, and then immediately realized that I wanted to play the whole thing. I think this is a great example of what a creature-catching game should look like in 2015; I'm really enjoying the open world aspect and the level of control you have over what you're doing at any given time (don't want to battle right now? You can skip almost all of them. Don't want to do story quests right now? Don't). The real-time battle mechanics are also a pretty nice change from the turn-based battles in Pokemon.</dd>

          <dd>I play a JRPG every couple of years, and this was the one this year. I'm impressed by the size of the world and how smoothly it plays on the Wii U.</dd>

          <dd>This was a harder puzzler than I expected it to be; art looks super nice and a really cool lock unlocking minigame though.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://www.axiomverge.com/">Axiom Verge</a></dt>
          <dd>A fantastic metroidvania and probably my game of the year. Great level design, very interesting gameplay mechanics, and then the sudden realization that it was all made by one person over five years. Amazing.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://www.heatpotgames.com/">Hero Emblems</a></dt>
          <dd>A side scrolling match three game with some pretty cute art. I have a weak spot for match three games; this one goes much better if you buy some better emblems as fast as possible.</dd>
