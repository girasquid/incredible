          <dd>A cute infinite runner about snowboarding and llamas. Really well done goal progression; reminiscent of Tiny Wings.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://strikesuitzero.com/">Strike Suit Zero</a></dt>
          <dd>You are a space pilot. You gain control of a fighter that can transform into a mech. Weird concept, but they <em>nailed</em> space opera game controls. Firing a missile never felt so good.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a></dt>
          <dd>A game of deceipt and secret strategies. Takes a while (2hrs+) to play; can end friendships.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mujo/id882416288?mt=8&at=11l5NI">MUJO</a></dt>
          <dd>A match-three puzzler game with an interesting stacking mechanic and an energy gate that feels kind of forced.</dd>

          <dd>A korean-style iOS MMORPG. Good combat; reminds me a lot of Diablo 3.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123540/tokaido">Tokaido</a></dt>
          <dd>A game about accumulating the most life experience while crossing Japan's east sea road. Probably the most peaceful, quietly competitive game I've played.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://g2g.amplitude-studios.com/Games/Dungeon-of-the-Endless">Dungeon of the Endless</a></dt>
          <dd>This game is a mashup of a lot of different concepts - roguelike procedural exploration, squad tactics, and tower defense. It's also turned based, which was a surprise. Pretty good; I found singleplayer to be crushingly difficult, but hear multiplayer is better.</dd>
