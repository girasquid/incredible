          <dd>At first the "bomb" in the name made me think this was a keto recipe; the biscuits you use definitely make it not a keto recipe. Not bad, nothing to really write home about. Easy to put together.</dd>

          <dd>A cute infinite runner about snowboarding and llamas. Really well done goal progression; reminiscent of Tiny Wings.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://strikesuitzero.com/">Strike Suit Zero</a></dt>
          <dd>You are a space pilot. You gain control of a fighter that can transform into a mech. Weird concept, but they <em>nailed</em> space opera game controls. Firing a missile never felt so good.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/37111/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a></dt>
          <dd>A game of deceipt and secret strategies. Takes a while (2hrs+) to play; can end friendships.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/mujo/id882416288?mt=8&at=11l5NI">MUJO</a></dt>
          <dd>A match-three puzzler game with an interesting stacking mechanic and an energy gate that feels kind of forced.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/taichi-panda/id944892716?mt=8&at=11l5NI">Taichi Panda</a></dt>
          <dd>A korean-style iOS MMORPG. Good combat; reminds me a lot of Diablo 3.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123540/tokaido">Tokaido</a></dt>
          <dd>A game about accumulating the most life experience while crossing Japan's east sea road. Probably the most peaceful, quietly competitive game I've played.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://g2g.amplitude-studios.com/Games/Dungeon-of-the-Endless">Dungeon of the Endless</a></dt>
          <dd>This game is a mashup of a lot of different concepts - roguelike procedural exploration, squad tactics, and tower defense. It's also turned based, which was a surprise. Pretty good; I found singleplayer to be crushingly difficult, but hear multiplayer is better.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/astro-duel/id548898306?mt=8&at=11l5NI">Astro Duel</a></dt>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://ashervo.itch.io/royals">Royals</a></dt>
          <dd>Steep learning curve, but rewarding to play. I'm really impressed with how solid the UI is, especially when dealing with followers vs. yourself.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/p/cookservedelicious_storefront">Cook, Serve, Delicious!</a></dt>
          <dd>A restaurant simulation game with pretty well done controls, if a slightly simple tutorial (wall of text).</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/burrito-bison/id519781433?mt=8&at=11l5NI">Burrito Bison</a></dt>
          <dd>A pretty good launch game; the variety in the gummies you encounter and the fact that you have to do more than just watch the game play itself is nice. I also thought it was cool that it has an end.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://a-dire-fawn.itch.io/diesel-dm">(ASMR) Vin Diesel DMing a Game of D&D Just For You</a></dt>

          <dd>A really well done turn-based roguelike with an interesting inventory/city building mechanic that makes finding gear much more rewarding. I have high hopes that <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/180322771/rogue-wizards-fantasy-role-playing-game-rpg">Rogue Wizards</a> will be like this.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://www.disparitygames.com/ninja-pizza-girl/">Ninja Pizza Girl</a></dt>
          <dd>I got access to an early build of this - the game has potential, but it's not there yet.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://clickerheroes.com">Clicker Heroes</a></dt>
          <dd>A master class in skinner box design, packaged in an incremental game. Has an interesting reset-but-play-through-faster mechanic.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="http://rayman.ubi.com/legends/en-gb/home/">Rayman Legends</a></dt>
          <dd>I read a review of this game that called it "platforming perfection"; I'm inclined to agree. Super well done and the co-op is fantastic as well (and fully co-operative; nothing you do detracts from the other player in any way, and you can't steal their resources).</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16992/tsuro">Tsuro</a></dt>
          <dd>A game about building interconnected paths in order to knock out the other dragons. Super easy to get into.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/41114/resistance">The Resistance</a></dt>
          <dd>Another lying game like Battlestar Galactica, but heavier on the lying and much less complex. Good, although hard for the good guys to win (which makes those ones feel even more rewarding).</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100901/flash-point-fire-rescue">Flash Point: Fire Rescue</a></dt>
          <dd>You and friends play firefighters trying to get people out of a burning building. This game had a lot of complexity to it that none of us were expecting; we lost because I don't think we understood what to do for the first half of the game.</dd>

          <dt><a href="http://www.explodingkittens.com/">Exploding Kittens</a></dt>
          <dd>Reminds me of UNO a little bit - the start of the game is kind of slow, but the intensity continually escalates. The end of the game becomes very high intensity as everyone tries to take each other out.</dd>

          <dt class="recommended"><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/681/quarto">Quarto!</a></dt>
          <dd>A connect four game that's based on recognizing the similarities between the pieces you're connecting, with an interesting mechanic: the other player chooses what piece you place next.</dd>

          <dt><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21763/mr-jack">Mr. Jack</a></dt>
          <dd>A stealth game where one player plays Jack the ripper and the other plays a detective trying to catch him. Interesting mechanics, although a bit slow to get started.</dd>

          <dd>Very cool movement mechanic where you can mosey along or go for full engine burns, but on our first playthrough we struggled with figuring out whether we wanted to play the game for a while and experience it all or just race to the goal. Comes with multiple scenarios so that the victory condition is different each time you play, which opens up a lot of options for playing it again but being forced into different strategies. A little complex at first.</dd>

          <dd>If you ever wanted to create your own Mario levels, this is the game for you. Lots of interesting interactions between game pieces, a solid level editor, and more levels and creativity on display than you can shake a stick at.</dd>

          <dd>A (poorly-named) stealth game designed to play like a legend of zelda dungeon. I did the art myself.</dd>
